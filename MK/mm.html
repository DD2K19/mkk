       <ul>
         <li>If you were a vegetable you'd be a cute-cumber.</li>
         <li>If I were a cat I'd spend all 9 lives with you.</li>
         <li>Even if there wasn't gravity on earth, I'd still fall for you.</li>
         <li>If God made anything more beautiful than you, I'm sure he'd keep it for himself.</li>
         <li>Do I know you? Cause you look exactly like my next girlfriend.</li>
         <li>I was blinded by your beauty... I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.</li>
         <li>I thought happiness started with an H. Why does mine start with U?</li>
         <li>Is your name Ariel? Cause we Mermaid for each other!</li>
         <li>Most guys need 3 meals a day to keep going... I just need eye contact from you.</li>
         <li>I must be a snowflake, because I've fallen for you.</li>

       <h2 class="R2">Mary..</h2>
       <p>This was the mind-blowing surprise I was talking about.
         They say love is not shown in word but in deed so i guess this shows that I really LOVE YOU.</p>
       <p>lots of love,</p>

      <p>"Love to me is someone telling me, ‘I want to be with you for the rest of my life,
         and if you needed me to I’d jump out of a plane for you."</p>
      <p>“Love is just a word, but you bring it definition.”</p>
